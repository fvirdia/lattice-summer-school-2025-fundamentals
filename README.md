# lattice-summer-school-2025-fundamentals

In this repository you can find two lab sheets.

They are intended to introduce you to the basic syntax of fplll, and to let you verify the Gaussian heuristic and the Geometric Series Assumption over q-ary lattices.

For ease of use, I recommend running these on https://cocalc.com
You can create a free account, which gives you access to an Ubuntu virtual machine with Sagemath preinstalled.
From there, you can create a Sagemath notebook, and perform the computations suggested in the lab.

You can also find the slides on Lattice fundamentals, for reference.
